# JHU-CIS1-PA4
This is work for CIS1 Fall 2021 PA4 program at JHU.
The user can directly use PA4_demos.py to operate the required operations with a change of input and save path.
In this PA, we assume 2 different types of dataset one is 'debug' and another is 'unknown'.

<1> Report is the experiment report

<2> The program part includes the PA4_demo.py as the main function and it depends on:

  As in this work we need to continue our work in PA3 with only an ICP algorithm realization, we continue building the ICP function in 
  the PA3_functions.py
  
  for more details about the ICP algorithm, please refer to our report for the algorithm and PA3_functions.py file for detial I/O about our functions.
  
# Aknowledgment

In this work, we use Python's package numpy, scipy and re.
